It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Client Strategist (CS) team is a key function within Coinbase Asset Management (CBAM). At CBAM a CS’s job is to build the business. This includes engaging prospects and developing them into clients (if appropriate).&amp;nbsp; At CBAM a Client Strategist is a hybrid between a salesperson and an investment strategist. A successful Client Strategist can secure the next 2-3 meetings during the initial conversation, and drive a deal towards funding. Post funding, Client Strategists design and deliver investor support, in concert with CBAM’s Director of Marketing and IR. A Strategist must understand the nuances of our business, such that they can represent the investment team and our investment process across regions. Client Strategists also contribute to marketing content, turning client feedback and market intelligence into better marketing narratives and better marketing collateral.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;50-70%: Supporting outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies in North America, Europe, Asia as led by the firm’s President.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;20-40%: Driving outbound selling of CBAM funds and strategies to institutional allocators across US Wealth, RIA, Family Office.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Research, propose, and execute Go-To_Market (GTM).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop deep relationships with and understanding of Institutional Allocators (Pensions, Sovereign Wealth Fund, Endowments, Foundations,&amp;nbsp; Wealth platforms, HNW and UHNW).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Drive maintenance and growth of the CBAM client base.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;10%-20%: Assisting in creation and maintenance of marketing collateral, in concert with the head of Marketing &amp;amp; IR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;7+ years of institutional sales experience at top tier global institutional asset manager.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Significant experience independently building relationships with Institutional Allocators.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;In particular, this role needs experience with allocators, RIAs, Wealth platforms in the US and EU, especially Wealth (Multi-family and Single Family offices).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Familiarity with, and ability to describe, investment concepts across Macro, Systematic, Private Credit, and Fundamental strategies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Strong working knowledge of digital assets, blockchain technology, crypto market structure, and an ability to drive interest in digital asset investment strategies.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Demonstrated capability to operate independently, to be flexible and to be relentless.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An ability to receive and give hard feedback.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Technical curiosity, deep interest in digital assets, markets, innovative technology.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Working familiarly with Bloomberg, Excel, Powerpoint &amp;amp; Salesforce.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nice to haves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Technical skills beyond above: ai, coding, python, statistical analysis.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Working understanding of crypto that can be demonstrated in high pr"

Think progress animations that make hitting daily targets feel like winning a game, ad campaigns that move people to take action on their health, celebration moments that turn healthy habits into shareable joy, and video content that breaks down complex health concepts into digestible, engaging stories.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone. But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment. Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Science is an integral component of Coinbase’s product and decision making process: we work in partnership with Product, Engineering and Design to influence the roadmap and better understand our users. With a deep expertise in experimentation, analytics and advanced modeling, we produce insights which directly move the company’s bottom line.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Perform analyses on products to answer open-ended questions and provide strategic recommendations.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Design and guide experiments/analysis to measure impact and drive product improvements.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain key metrics and reports, enhancing data infrastructure for better analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What we look for in you:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;At least a BA/BS in a quantitative field (ex Math, Stats, Physics, or Computer Science) with ≥2+ years of relevant experience.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience driving impact for a digital product with an iterative development cycle.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Understanding of statistical concepts and practical experience applying them (in A|B testing, causal inference, ML, etc.).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience in data analyses using SQL.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience in programming/modeling in Python.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Demonstration of our core cultural values: clear communication, positive energy, continuous learning, and efficient execution.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclaimer: Applying for a specific role does not guarantee consideration for that exact position.

We're entrepreneurs and degens, technologists and skeptics, troublemakers and problem solvers, who are building unstoppable tooling for the next generation of onchain organizations. Aragon launched the first DAO framework in 2017, securing over $35 billion in assets for the likes of Lido and Curve. We are currently building Aragon OSx, a toolkit for launching secure and modular organizations, and which is used by projects such as Polygon and Taiko. As a crossâfunctional engineering lead on Aragonâs Platform Team, youâll code and coordinate across frontend, backend, and our Aragon OSx smart contract frameworking, owning some of our most challenging features, architecture cohesion, operational discipline, and platform reliability so our onchain products ship fast and safely. For more info about what weâre up to, check out our latest blog, The Next Generation of Onchain Organizations . \\n ðª What youâll do Own the coordination ceremonies and touch points across frontend, backend, smart contracts, and SRE/DevOps so engineering stays technically aligned and the efforts grounded in actual product requirements. Provide guidance on architecture across the stack by aligning interfaces across components and making sure they fit together cleanly, while being mindful of dependencies and how design choices affect future flexibility. Define and prioritize technical work by balancing roadmap features against refactors and other engineering needs, and collaborate with Product on acceptance criteria so priorities reflect both strategic goals and practical trade-offs. Promote E2E production health by driving cultural practices and principles - for tests, release discipline, monitoring, and incident response - that make quality and security a default. Strengthen the team by mentoring engineers at every level and documenting critical knowledge and reference material so the team is always growing and without being dependent on any single person. Code! Even in a leadership role, the best way to understand and improve the stack is by working with it and writing code - frontend, backend, or contracts - reviewing peersâ work, and getting your hands dirty to help ship features! â ï¸ Minimum requirement Proven ability to oversee production systems where you owned their quality, from defining done, enforcing tests, managing regressions, and taking responsibility for release reliability Senior-level depth in either frontend (JS/TS and a modern framework, ideally React) or backend (Node/TS or similar) or ****both CI/CD literacy (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI) and practical understanding of monitoring/alerts and incident handling Experience working on open source projects, ideally in blockchain, cryptography, smart contracts, decentralized systems, or any related technology in the web3 ecosystem Experience as an engineering manager, tech lead, or similar technical leadership role, ideally for a remote team Experience working in agile environment, git flows, and are comfortable in the tools (e.g. Jira, Github) Passionate and an active user of web3 applications Excellent English communication - both written and oral ð¡ Bonus skills Ethereum/EVM mastery Experience building or working with blockchain indexers. Experience acting as Scrum Master Experience building monitoring systems yourself Experience working on a project with a module or plugin system Passionate about the possibilities of decentralized autonomous organizations and the impacts they may have on how humans work together to solve problems \\n We value freedom and responsibility among our contributors. In practice, this means that we're a remote distributed organization that's flexible as to where you want to work and your schedule. We will trust you to accommodate and support your team, and communicate if you ever feel stretched thin. You will get all of the resources needed to be effective, whether its for setting up your remote work environment or a personal development budget. This role reports to Aragon X, a Swiss AG dedicated to advancing the Aragon Project. We are an Equal Opportunity Employer supporting a community of DAO builders, developers, and users experimenting with new forms of social coordination and governance.

No APIs, no endless integrations, no cloud lock-in. Just an AI that works where you work, across all your apps and files, right on your device. And hereâs the crazy part: itâs already working. Weâve got blind users running their computers with Vy. Weâve got real estate agents, recruiters, developers, and ops managers using it daily to get things done. People all over the world are using Vy to do things they couldnât before â and spending way less time glued to their screens. Now weâre looking for our next teammate: a UX Designer / Product Designer / Frontend Engineer (with the emphasis on UX design). This isnât your typical âmake the button blueâ gig. Itâs about designing how humans will interact with AI at the operating system level. There are a ton of unknowns, weâre essentially defining a brand new category â which makes this role both a huge challenge and a huge opportunity. What weâd love in you: â¢ Deep passion for design and user experience (youâll be the one shaping how people interact with Vy). â¢ Ability to build â youâre not just a Figma wizard, you can jump into TypeScript and bring your designs to life. â¢ Curiosity and adaptability â this is uncharted territory. Weâre learning, experimenting, and reinventing daily. â¢ A strong sense of empathy â our users range from blind accessibility pioneers to busy professionals who just want their computers to work for them . Details: â¢ Weâre based in Seattle, but open to hybrid or remote if itâs the right fit. â¢ Weâre a well-funded startup, so youâll have both stability and the chance to move fast. â¢ Youâll be working directly with me and the core team, shaping not just a product but an entire new market. If youâve ever wanted to design something that could actually change how people use computers forever, this is that role.

Our pioneering products are designed for freelancers, consultants, and microentrepreneurs who want to focus on their craft - not the paperwork. With more than 100 team members globally, we're building the best possible version of solopreneurship. ð¤ As a Product Engineer at Xolo, you will: Design, build &amp; operate backend &amp; frontend services that power Xoloâs endâtoâend companyâmanagement platform.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up.

But if you want to build the future alongside others who excel in their disciplines and expect the same from you, there’s no better place to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While many roles at Coinbase are remote-first, we are not remote-only. In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment.

It’s big, it’s bold, and we’re already doing it. Through our crypto solutions for financial institutions, businesses, governments and developers, we are improving the global financial system and creating greater economic fairness and opportunity for more people, in more places around the world. And we get to do the best work of our career and grow our skills surrounded by colleagues who have our backs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;If you’re ready to see your impact and unlock incredible career growth opportunities, join us, and build real world value.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE WORK:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Ripple, the Customer Onboarding Platform is where every customer’s journey begins — and it’s about to get a full-scale rebuild.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We recently became a horizontal platform team serving &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; Ripple products. Our next chapter:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Unwinding years of Salesforce-bound logic into modern, engineering-owned backend services.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Integrating best-in-class vendors like Persona for KYC/KYB, while building the surrounding orchestration, data flows, and service layer.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Designing the systems and data model that will make onboarding scalable, observable, and reliable across products.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’re a Staff-level engineer who thrives on modernizing fragile systems, building robust services around vendor integrations, and driving architecture at company-wide scale, this is your opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHY THIS ROLE MATTERS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Onboarding is where customers form their first impression of Ripple — and where trust is earned.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone.

In-person participation is required throughout the year. Team and company-wide offsites are held multiple times annually to foster collaboration, connection, and alignment.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up. We want someone who will run towards, not away from, solving the company’s hardest problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/mission&quot;&gt;work culture&lt;/a&gt; is intense and isn’t for everyone.

Attendance is expected and fully supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security is a primary competency at Coinbase, and the Security Operations team keeps a watchful eye over every aspect of it. Every day, we go to battle against some of the most sophisticated attackers in the world to protect billions of dollars worth of digital assets and ensure that our customers and employees can enjoy a safe, trusted experience. As Coinbase scales globally, our team is scaling along with it, using a blend of tooling, automation, and strategic team growth to ensure that we’re well-equipped to protect the next billion users of crypto.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you’ll be doing (ie. job duties):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Security Operations group is a multi-functional organization that includes our CSIRT, Trust &amp;amp; Safety,&amp;nbsp; Threat Intelligence, and Insider Threat. While no two days will end up looking the same, generally-speaking you’ll be responsible for the following things:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Building and implementing detections, preventions, security controls, and automations to not only deter insider threats but improve holistic security posture&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Testing and maintaining security tooling, particularly for endpoint detection and investigation&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Collaborating cross-functionally with Security, Infrastructure, IT, and Legal to obtain necessary technical information and to evaluate and advise them of downstream impacts of their builds/deployments&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Linking disparate information such that it can be aggregated, visualized, and interpreted for indications of threat (via query builds, table joins, etc.)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Assisting with investigations as needed (this may involve rapidly building tools or extending&amp;nbsp; capabilities to aid response efforts).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you (ie. job requirements):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;You’ll be much more likely to be successful in this role if these bullet points seem like a good description of you:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;You have experience designing and implementing Insider Threat technologies (such as Security Information Event Management - SIEM, User Behavioral Analytics - UEBA, Data Loss Prevention - DLP) and an understanding of investigations and/or the intelligence cycle&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You are comfortable manipulating logs, tables, and data lakes to engineer custom&amp;nbsp; detections and&amp;nbsp; dashboards&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You’ve mastered SQL and coding languages like Python and regularly manipulate logs to create custom alerts and automations with SOAR&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You are comfortable working cross-functionally with infrastructure, IT, and response teams to design and implement technical controls&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You are actively aware of the insider threat landscape, and understand the legal, regulatory, and ethical considerations of working with sensitive information and situations&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You are discreet, thoughtful, and seek to coordinate systemic, cross functional&amp;nbsp; solutions to mitigate risk&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You are adept at translating complex problems into ‘byte-sized’, readily implemented (and preferably automated) solutions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You have excellent verbal and written communicati"

Staking is an integral part of the Custody experience because it allows customers to earn a yield on their digital assets. The Institutional Staking Engineering team also plays an important role in helping to secure underlying blockchain networks by unlocking billions of dollars worth of assets for staking that would otherwise remain unstaked on the sideline. These additional funds contribute to security of networks by increasing the costs of 51% attacks and increasing the diversity and decentralization of validators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What you&#39;ll be doing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Build new services to meet critical product and business needs using Golang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Design scalable systems to solve novel problems with modern cloud technology and industry best practices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Articulate a long term vision for maintaining and scaling our backend systems and the teams running them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Work with engineers, designers, product managers and senior leadership to turn our product and technical vision into a tangible roadmap every quarter.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;Write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we look for in you:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You have at least 5 years of experience in software engineering.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You’ve designed, built, scaled and maintained production services, and know how to compose a service oriented architecture.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;You write high quality, well tested code to meet the needs of your customers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li style=&quot;font-weight: 400;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-"

We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system. We want someone who is eager to leave their mark on the world, who relishes the pressure and privilege of working with high caliber colleagues, and who actively seeks feedback to keep leveling up.

It’s a massive, ambitious opportunity that demands the best of us, every day, as we build the emerging onchain platform — and with it, the future global financial system.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To achieve our mission, we’re seeking a very specific candidate. We want someone who is passionate about our mission and who believes in the power of crypto and blockchain technology to update the financial system.
