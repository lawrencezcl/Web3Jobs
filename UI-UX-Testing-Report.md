| Responsive Rendering | No layout shifts | ✅ Good |
| Mock Data Loading | ~3 seconds | ✅ Acceptable |

## Issues Identified

### No Critical Issues Found 🎉

**Minor Observations:**

2. Mock mode requires 3 seconds to load sample data (acceptable for demo purposes)
3. Some job cards show "Salary not specified" (normal for real-world data)

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **None** - All core functionality is working correctly

### Medium Priority
1. **Add Loading Indicators**: Consider adding spinners during mock data loading
2. **Enhance Empty State**: Could add more engaging empty state illustrations
3. **Salary Filtering**: Could add salary range filters when data is available

### Low Priority
1. **Animation Enhancements**: Add subtle animations for better user feedback
2. **Advanced Search**: Could add more sophisticated search operators
3. **Job Alerts**: Consider adding job alert functionality
